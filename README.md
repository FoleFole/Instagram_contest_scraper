# Instagram_contest_scraper
My friend competed in an Instagram contest so I made this script to count the votes.
In the contest there were three images in a post labeled 1 -> 3. People submitted their votes by typing 
the number of their favorite submission.

This script utilizes Selenium for automation and BeautifulSoup4 for collecting the votes.

Todo: improve scraping accuracy
