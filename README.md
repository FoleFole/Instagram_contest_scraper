# Instagram_contest_scraper
My friend competed in an Instagram contest so I made this script to count the votes.

##Overview
In the contest thpostere were three images in a  labeled 1 -> 3. People submitted their votes by typing 
the number of their favorite submission in the comments.

##Problem
As you can imagine, if my friend wanted to see if he was in the lead for votes, he would have to manually count 1k+ comments and keep track of them.

#How this works
This script utilizes Selenium for automation to click through the 'more comments' box and BeautifulSoup4 for collecting the votes.

#Result
My friend won the contest and we actually forecasted his victory a couple days in advanced based on the rate at which he was garning votes.
